# parallel_algorithms
Implementation of numerious parallel algorithms containing the serial, omp and mpi configurations.
There is a bash script `(run.sh)` in the top directory of the project
This will execute all other scripts for each implementation we've done

## Requirements
```
sudo apt install dos2unix
```
The `dos2unix` command is useful for converting text files between different line ending formats (e.g., Windows CRLF to Unix LF). Running the above command with `sudo` will install `dos2unix` using `apt` package manager on Debian-based systems. Make sure you have appropriate permissions to install packages using `apt`.

Note: only necessary if you get a bad interpreter error
